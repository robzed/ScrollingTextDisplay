Well congratulations! Welcome to the ways of the Forth. You are not just another weak-minded Imperial Stormtrooper!
OBJECTIVES

PADAWAN CLASS
Write a Hello World program that displays the message as a scrolling message on a serial terminal or equivalent (character LCD etc). The code should print HELLO WORLD! followed by 4 spaces and then after a horizontal scrolling delay it should repeat the message starting from the next character for a total of 16 characters including spaces. Therefore when the end of the string including spaces is reached it should wrap-around back to the start until 16 characters are printed.
The scrolling effect is achieved by a delay after printing 16 characters and then returning to the start of the same line and advance to the next character in the message for 16 characters with wrap-around.
